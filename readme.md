The goal of this project is to simulate the velocity change during the imapct process.
"target_flyer_system" is the main code.
"Quad2D4Node_Stiffness" describes the stiffness matrix of the element.
"Quad2D4Node_mass" describes the mass matrix of the element.
"simplifiedprocess" gives two different global stiffness matrix under two different conditions.
"PlotFieldonMesh" plots the figure of the target after impact.
